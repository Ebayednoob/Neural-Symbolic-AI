# Neural-Symbolic AI: A Comprehensive Overview

## Understanding Neural-Symbolic AI

Neural-symbolic AI represents a transformative approach that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems to create more robust, interpretable, and capable artificial intelligence systems. This hybrid paradigm combines the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks with the logical reasoning and knowledge representation strengths of symbolic AI.

The fundamental concept addresses the limitations of each approach when used independently—neural networks excel at learning from data but struggle with explainability and logical reasoning, while symbolic systems provide clear reasoning paths but lack adaptability and learning capabilities.

At its core, neural-symbolic AI aims to bridge the gap between two distinct cognitive processes that mirror Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory of human thinking:

- **System 1 thinking**: fast, intuitive, and automatic responses (aligned with neural networks)
- **System 2 thinking**: slower, deliberate, and logical reasoning (aligned with symbolic AI)

## Rotary Positional Embeddings and Mathematical Foundations

**Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)** is an advanced position encoding technique in transformers. Key features:

- Encodes absolute and relative positional information using rotation matrices.
- Treats features as 2D coordinate pairs, rotated by position-based angles.
- Offers better generalization to longer sequences and efficiency on GPU hardware.

## Quaternions and Hyperbolic Embeddings

- **Quaternion CNNs (QCNNs)**:
  - Represent color images as quaternion matrices.
  - Enable scale and rotation operations in color space.
  
- **Hyperbolic Embeddings**:
  - Ideal for hierarchical data.
  - **Hyperbolic GCNs (HGCNs)**: Up to 63.1% improvement over Euclidean models.
  
- **Hyperbolic Quaternion Algebras**:
  - A theoretical structure supporting complex symbolic representations.
